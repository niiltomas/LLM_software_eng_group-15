        <h2>Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs)</h2>
        <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are artificial intelligence systems designed to understand and generate human-like text. These models are trained on vast amounts of data, enabling them to predict and create coherent and contextually relevant language outputs.</p>
        <p>LLMs utilize deep learning techniques, especially transformer architectures, to capture the nuances of human language. They can perform a variety of tasks without task-specific training, thanks to their general language understanding capabilities.</p>
        <h3>Common Use Cases:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Chatbots and conversational agents for customer support</li>
            <li>Automated content creation and summarization</li>
            <li>Language translation and localization</li>
            <li>Code generation and software development assistance</li>
            <li>Advanced data analysis and research summarization</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="ethical-risks">
        <h2>Ethical Risks of LLMs</h2>
        <p>Despite their impressive capabilities, Large Language Models come with significant ethical considerations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Misinformation:</strong> LLMs can generate false or misleading information with high confidence, leading to potential harm.</li>
            <li><strong>Bias:</strong> Training data often contains societal biases, which can be reflected and amplified in model outputs.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> If not handled carefully, LLMs may inadvertently expose sensitive data from their training sets.</li>
        </ul>
